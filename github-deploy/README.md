# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy a static website to GitHub Pages whenever the `index.html` file is changed.

## How It Works
- The repository contains a simple `index.html` file.
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) is configured to deploy the website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
- The website is accessible at: `https://<username>.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/`.
