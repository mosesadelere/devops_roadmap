Explanation of the Script  

    Variables : 
        GIT_REPO: The URL of the Git repository to clone.
        PROJECT_DIR: The directory where the project will be cloned or updated.
        DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME: The name of the Docker image to build.
        DB_MIGRATION_SCRIPT: The path to the database migration script (e.g., migrate.sh).
         

    Step 1: Clone or Update the Git Repository  
        If the project directory already exists, the script pulls the latest changes from the repository.
        Otherwise, it clones the repository into the specified directory.
         

    Step 2: Build the Docker Image  
        The script builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the project directory.
         

    Step 3: Deploy the Docker Container  
        The script uses docker-compose to deploy the application as a Docker container.
         

    Step 4: Run Database Migrations  
        The script checks for the existence of a database migration script (migrate.sh) and runs it if present.
        You can customize this step based on your database migration tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, or custom scripts).
         

    Step 5: Verify Application Status  
        The script verifies that the Docker container is running by checking its status with docker ps.
         

    Error Handling : 
        The script exits with an error message if any step fails.
         
     

Prerequisites  

    Install Docker and Docker Compose : 
        Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
        On Ubuntu:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
    sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker
     
     
     

Git Repository : 

    Replace https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git with the actual URL of your Git repository.
     

Database Migration Script : 

    Ensure the database migration script (migrate.sh) exists in the project directory and is executable:
   
    chmod +x migrate.sh
     
     
     

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml : 

    Ensure the project directory contains a valid Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file.
